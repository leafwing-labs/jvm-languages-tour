# A Tour of JVM Languages

The main JVM languages

## Pitch

And then there was bytecode...

Tired of the same old Java program? Join us for a tour of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) languages, their unique features,
and the advantages they offer to developers.

In a world where software development is constantly evolving, the JVM ecosystem provides a platform for experimentation
and innovation. From Kotlin to Scala, Groovy to Clojure, the JVM offers a diverse range of tools and frameworks
that cater to different programming styles and application requirements.

In this talk, we'll explore the evolution of the JVM, the rise of alternative languages, and the impact they have on
modern
software development. Whether you're a seasoned Java developer or a curious tech enthusiast, this session will open your
eyes to the rich and vibrant world of JVM languages.

## Components

> "A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language
> also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about **processes**. Thus, when we describe a language,
> we
> should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more
> complex
> ideas." - _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_

**Computation Process** => "Abstract being that inhabits a computer"

### Intro Story

_Writing an OAuth2 server in Clojure_

> My programming language (Clojure) is not better than yours... except it is.

We have emotional attachments to our programming languages. We love them, we hate them, we argue about them.
