// An {{ORDER}} is noted with an espresso shot number x ranging between 1 and 4, and an optional
// letter L that indicates that the student wants to have a x-shot latte. For example, an order
// 2 means a 2-shot espresso, and an order 3L means a 3-shot latte:
//
//  - Making an x-shot espresso consumes x ounces of water
//  - Making a latte requires steaming milk and consumes one additional ounce of water

// The espresso machine at the micro kitchen has a water {{TANK}} of `s` ounces that is full at the
// beginning of the day. John refills the water tank to s ounces whenever the remaining water in
// the tank is not enough to fulfill the next studentâ€™s order.
//
// How many times do John have to {{REFILL}} the water tank today in order to serve all
// `n` students?
